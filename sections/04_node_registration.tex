\section{Node Registration}\label{sec:node-registration}
As soon as a node comes online (or when it receives a \texttt{node\_info\_req}), it enters the registration phase. See Figure \ref{fig:node-registration-flow} for a graphical representation the whole registration procedure. Here it sends out a \texttt{node\_info\_announcement}.
This announces the node to the bus and includes its name, number of telemetryValues and parameters, and its firmware version through
the firmware and LiquidCan hashes (see \ref{struct:NodeInfoRes}). The central server registers the new node and waits for \texttt{field\_registration} messages. From this point on the 
node is able to send/receive messages on the bus.
