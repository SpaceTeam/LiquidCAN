% - Protocol versioning strategy
% - Backwards compatibility rules
% - How to handle unknown message types
This protocol uses semantic versioning.
See \href{https://semver.org/}{https://semver.org/} for a detailed description. A minor update version would, for example, be adding a new datatype or a new message type . Every update of the document must trigger an update of the liquidCAN repo, containing the Rust and C code for each implementation. The updated repo must be reflected in the \texttt{liquidcan\_hash} field of the \texttt{node\_info\_announcement} used in the firmware/server. 

\paragraph{}
The Firmware in the system can run with minor or patch version differences, "major" changes are not allowed to run simulaneously.
The server can inform the operators in case there is firmware running with different major versions.
